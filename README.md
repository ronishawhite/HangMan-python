Hey this is my hangman game, I was not able to get a fancy picture of a stick figure to replicate the game completely but it works just the same. There is a number of max guesses you can make (15) just like the actual game where if you draw the stick figure completely your turn is up. Take a peak into the code to find the word bank and test out the code for a winning game it will tell you how many guesses it took you to get it right. Have fun, Enjoy!
